- NodeJS is not a framework or a language, its a JavaScript Runtime
- JavaScript is single threaded and loosely typed
- JavaScript is interpreted language
- To take advantage of the asynchronous nature of JavaScript, we need callbacks
- Asynchronous tasks is JS don't necessarily run on the same thread as the main JS execution.
